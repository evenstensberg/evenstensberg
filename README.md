## Hi, I'm Even!

** I've been actively involved as one of the maintainers of [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), where I am creating the user interface (CLI) developers will use, and are using for their applications. 


I've been contributing to webpack since around 2016/2017 in a combination of being a collaborator, mentor for Google Summer of Code Students and as a vivid enthusiast for the Command Line Interface efforts and usability of webpack (amongst many other superb people)! ü•∞

If you need mentorship or webpack related help, you can sponsor me, and I'll help you as much as possible!


_My goal with GitHub sponsors is to be able to work part-time with OSS that is essential to the web continuing to thrive._ 

Thanks for taking time to read this, you can sponsor me [here](https://github.com/sponsors/evenstensberg) ‚ô•Ô∏è
