## Hi, I'm Even!

**I'm a University Student in Norway**, studying a variation of Computer Science, namely Informatics. I've been actively involved as one of the maintainers of [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), where I am creating the user interface (CLI) developers will use, and are using for their applications. 


I've been contributing to webpack since around 2016/2017 in a combination of being a collaborator, mentor for Google Summer of Code Students and as a vivid enthusiast for the Command Line Interface efforts and usability of webpack (amongst many other superb people)! 🥰

Other than that, I like to exercise by doing CrossFit 🏋🏽‍♀️, Soccer ⚽️ and kayaking 🚣🏼‍♂️

_My goal with GitHub sponsors is to be able to study and to work with OSS that is essential to the web continuing to thrive._ 

Thanks for taking time to read this, you can sponsor me [here](https://github.com/sponsors/evenstensberg) ♥️
