# CrossFit Salzburg

When visting Munich, I took a train ride to Salzburg and spent a day there. CrossFit Salzburg had an open BlackBox and I visited when there was a group session going on. The community there seemed great. If you like the Austrian nature around you while exercising, I'd definitely consider visiting CrossFit Salzburg. While doing pull-ups in the sundown, a pack of deers came by, which was an unique experience. Salzburg has beautiful scenery and a visit there is highly adviced!
