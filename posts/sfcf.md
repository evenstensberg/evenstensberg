# San Fransisco CrossFit

In October, I visited the United States. During the stay I was in California to visit. SFCrossfit, or San Fransisco CrossFit had a beautiful location by the Golden Gate Bridge and the Pier of San Fransisco. The BlackBox there was long in length but somewhat small in width. Anyway, it was a great experience and they had all sorts of equipment that you could use.
