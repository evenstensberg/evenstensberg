# CrossFit Munich

CrossFit Munich was really fun. The center had several rooms that you could exercise in, and to have different workouts in groups. It had a lot of Black Boxes and lifting areas. If you are in Munich, I would consider dropping by the center to have a drop-in and to see if it is for you. Most likely a group session is the best, since the center was built around group sessions, not individual workouts.
