# GitHub Sponsors

I have been doing OSS for a while now, and since I am studying and do not have a job at the moment and I want to continue to do Open Source, I need your help.


## A little background

I am Even Stensberg (21 year old Norwegian), one of the maintainers of [webpack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webpack), a Cross Project Council member for the [OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org/about/) and a Computer Science Student (Informatics) in [Northern Norway](https://en.uit.no/om/enhet/forsiden?p_dimension_id=210108). 

For the most part, I am self-taught. I started learning programming with C++ around 6th grade, continuing to take online-courses and reading books about C++ programming. At junior high school (7th-9th grade) I took a lot of online courses about web development and general programming from Udacity, Coursera and similar. I took three courses from Stanford University in 2014 about Machine Learning, Advanced Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Introduction Database Systems. Loved it and decided to stick with web development. 

I started doing Web Development professionally in high school, my first employment being as a Front End Developer for the summer of 2016 at [Dossier Solutions](https://www.dossier.com/) in Oslo. Since then, I have done consulancy (one of those for Google), a full time employee for [Telia](https://www.teliacompany.com/en/) for a while, intern at one of the most promising (and friendly colleagues there is) startups in Norway, [Cognite](https://www.cognite.com/).


These days I spend on Open Source with webpack, being a mentory for Google Summer of Code, a active member in the OpenJS Foundation and studying. I am finishing a Bachelors in Informatics fall of 2020 (I am on my last year of education). I was hoping to continue to study while working, and one of those options is to go work for Google, which I might do, except I need to finish my responsibilities for webpack first, which serves the whole community. In 2017 and 2018, I was working full-time while studying and doing Open Source, which took a big hit on my mental health.

My hobbies are not bound to Open Source, on my spare time I like to do CrossFit, Kayaking and I like to play soccer. Just recently my friends have introduced me to Rock Climbing as well, which I find very interesting! 

## So?...


If you are interested in sponsoring my work, that would be much appreciated. I really want to start the book I want to write for O'reily media, named "Web Performance: The definitive Guide", deliver webpack CLI, webpack UI and continue to make the web a better place. These things take time, effort and is time consuming. If I cannot have a viable income, then I will need to work, putting Open Source aside before finishing what is affecting the whole ecosystem.

## webpack CLI

Webpack CLI is the Command Line Interface of webpack, how you interact with webpack and how it is to use. I have spent the last years trying to make a change of how webpack is used with the CLI, making it easier to start with, while having powerful functionality and setting developers up for their success. We are very close to releasing, and I am looking forward to hear feedback about how it will be. The new CLI will be easier to interact with, have performance audits built in, with a good set of defaults, that will make web development much easier. 

## webpack UI 

This is under works, which is a web-based interface for interacting with webpack, creating new projects and monitoring behaviour of your builds.

## Other


### NASA

In the past, I have contributed to NASA AMESes Open Source framework and platform, [OpenMCT](https://nasa.github.io/openmct/), which I would like to continue to do. I have made plugins and contributed to their source code, which I am very proud of. One of those reasons is because you are able to help humans in research and science, and rockets themselves are a pretty cool concept. 

~ "We are extremely grateful for your contributions. NASA is kind of new to open source but we think itâ€™s a great way for people to get involved in the work that we do, and to be involved in exploring the solar system!"


### Google

I have contributed to the performance library, [lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) in the prior years, and I would like to continue to do so! One of those, is that you get handy feedback on what is/and what is not performant with your current webpage.


### Mentoring

I am one of the mentors for webpack that helps students get into Open Source and Software Engineering, which I would also like to continue to do!
